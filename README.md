Welcome to the Hangman Game, a fun and interactive word-guessing game where players try to guess the hidden word, one letter at a time, before the hangman is fully drawn!

Hints: Get a clue when you're stuck!
Engaging Animations: Smooth animations and effects for a delightful user experience.

🚀 How to Play
A word will be randomly selected and displayed as a series of blank spaces.
